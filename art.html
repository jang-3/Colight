        <hr class="change" />
        <p>
          The A.R.T. of Safe Interruption is a practical, youth-focused approach
          to safely stepping in when someone might be experiencing domestic
          violence. It stands for:
          <strong
            >Approach calmly, Respond with care, and Talk without blame</strong
          >. This model equips youth aged 17–24 with the tools, confidence, and
          empathy to act without escalating harm — showing that speaking up
          doesn't require heroics, just heart.
        </p>

        <h1>Approach Calmly</h1>
        <p>
          Take a moment to ground yourself before you act. If you sense
          something is wrong, don't rush or confront aggressively. Instead,
          approach with calm body language and a non-threatening presence.
          Whether you're sending a message, checking in quietly, or offering
          company, the goal is to reduce tension, not add to it.
        </p>

        <h1>Respond with Care</h1>
        <p>
          When someone opens up, the most powerful thing you can do is listen.
          Don’t interrupt or jump to solutions — just be present. Say things
          like, “That sounds really tough,” or “Thank you for trusting me.” Let
          them know their feelings are valid. You’re not there to fix things —
          you’re there to hold space.
        </p>

        <h1>Talk Without Blame</h1>
        <p>
          Avoid language that judges or pressures. Saying “Why don’t you just
          leave?” can make someone feel ashamed or defensive. Instead, use “I”
          statements: “I noticed you seemed a bit off today,” or “I’m here if
          you ever want to talk.” Gently offer help or direct them to support
          resources, but always let them choose what’s next.
        </p>

        <h1>Why A.R.T. Matters</h1>
        <p>
          Domestic violence often hides in plain sight — in controlling
          behavior, emotional manipulation, or isolation. The A.R.T. model gives
          young people a safe, effective way to act without overstepping. It
          reminds us that you don’t need to rescue someone to make a difference
          — just showing up with calm, care, and compassion can be enough to
          open a door to safety.
