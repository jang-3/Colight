      <h1>What is Domestic Violence?</h1>
      <p>
        Domestic violence is any form of abuse — physical, emotional,
        psychological, sexual, or financial — that happens in a close
        relationship, often involving a partner, family member, or someone
        living in the same household. It’s about one person trying to control or
        harm another through fear, threats, or force.

            <h4>Young children speak up less — but are harmed more.</h4>
            Children aged 0-6 also dominate Tier 2 child abuse due to inability

          <p>
            Everyone has a role in preventing abuse. You don’t have to be a
            professional or have all the answers. What matters is showing that
            abuse is not invisible, and survivors are not alone. Silence often
            enables harm—your voice can be a lifeline.

          <h1>How and why you should help</h1>
          <p>
            Being a bystander doesn't mean being powerless. When you recognize
            signs of domestic violence and choose to intervene—whether through
            words, action, or support—you become part of the solution. Even the
            smallest gesture, like asking “Are you okay?” or offering resources,
            can interrupt a cycle of abuse. These acts create ripples,
            encouraging others to step up and sending a clear message that abuse
            is not tolerated.

            <h4>What if I'm not sure someone is being abused?</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Trust your instincts. You don't need to confirm abuse to check in
              with someone. Ask how they’re doing, express concern, and let them
              know you’re there to talk or help. Listen without judgment.

            <h4>How can I help without making things worse?</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Avoid confrontation with the abuser. Focus on the victim’s needs.
              Offer emotional support and resources, not ultimatums. Respect
              their pace—they know their situation best. Your role is to
              support, not rescue.

            <h4>Is it safe to get involved?</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Safety is a priority—for both the person experiencing abuse and
              yourself. If someone is in immediate danger, call emergency
              services. Otherwise, support can be offered discreetly, such as
              providing hotline numbers, suggesting a safety plan, or checking
              in regularly.

            <h4>Can I help even if I'm not a professional?</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              Absolutely. Empathy, consistency, and connection are powerful
              tools. You don’t need to be an expert to show someone they’re not
              alone or to guide them to trained professionals who can help.

            <h4>What if the person denies anything is wrong?</h4>
            <hr />
            <p>
              That’s okay. Many people aren’t ready to talk, or may not see
              their experience as abuse. Keep the door open. Let them know you
              care and are available whenever they’re ready.

            <p>
              Provide contact info for local shelters, hotlines, or advocacy
              groups. National options include:
            </p>

            <p>
              Frequent unexplained injuries, withdrawal from friends or
              activities, hyper-vigilance, excessive communication from a
              controlling partner, or isolation can be red flags. Pay attention
              to shifts in mood, appearance, or behavior.
