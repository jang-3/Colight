          We are CoLight, a multidisciplinary student team passionate about
          using immersive media to advocate for social causes. Comprising
          designers, developers, and storytellers from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, we
          believe in the power of empathy, creativity, and technology to inspire
          change. Our work is rooted in compassion, driven by data, and informed
          by lived experiences — we stand against domestic violence and strive
          to amplify the voices of survivors and bystanders alike.

        <p>
          Our mission is to empower youth aged 17–24 to recognize that domestic
          violence is not a private matter, and to equip them with the tools and
          confidence to intervene safely using the A.R.T. of Safe Interruption
          model. Through a combination of immersive experiences, storytelling,
          and interactive digital tools, we aim to transform passive awareness
          into active responsibility, shifting mindsets and fostering a culture
          of safe intervention and support.

        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px">Our Approach</h1>
        <hr class="change" />
        <p>
          We are executing the campaign through a multi-platform strategy
          grounded in interactive engagement and emotional storytelling:
          Personality Quiz: Helps youth identify their bystander type and learn
          how to intervene based on their traits. WebAR Filter & AI Image
          Generator: Leverages immersive media to personalize intervention
          messages and encourage social sharing. Interactive Projection & VR
          Dart Game: Educates through hands-on activities at our NP booth,
          reinforcing safe intervention practices. Social Experiments & Public
          Activations: Conducted across polytechnics and Orchard Road to observe
          real reactions and raise awareness. Instagram & TikTok Campaigns:
          Distributes relatable and sharable content tied to personas and the
          A.R.T. model. Bingo Card Challenge: Encourages deeper participation
          and rewards youth for engaging with the campaign.

        <h1 style="margin-bottom: 30px">Why It Matters</h1>
        <hr class="change" />
        <p>
          Why this issue is important to us and our peers Domestic violence
          often hides behind silence and misconceptions, especially among youth
          who may feel it's not their place to step in. Our peers may witness
          signs but hesitate due to fear, uncertainty, or apathy. As young
          adults ourselves, we’ve seen how a lack of awareness or confidence can
          prevent action. This campaign matters because it equips us — and our
          generation — with the language, tools, and courage to break the cycle
          of silence. By normalizing intervention, we are fostering a safer,
          more supportive community for everyone.
